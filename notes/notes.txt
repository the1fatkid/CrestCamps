---------------------------ArboraDome Project Notes---------------------------

/* Setting up Bootstrap */
    Step 1: Download Source Code Files of Bootstrap from getbootstrap.com and add extract them in your project folder

    Step 2: Inside your Project Folder,make the following folders and files
        --->css
            -> main.css (this will come from PrePros after compilation of .scss file)
        --->scss
            -> custom_bootstrap.scss (@import bootsrap and override default colors)
            -> custom.scss (write custom scss here, just the way you do in a styles.css file)
            -> main.scss (@import the other 2 files together in the same order as written above)
        ---> index.html   

    Step 3: Use PrePros to compile the main.scss file and you're all set! (Test by changing the background color in custom.scss file)


/* Changing Boostrap colors with Custom colors*/

    $theme-colors: (
    "primary": #b57edc,
    "secondary":#ff69b4,
    "primary-emphasis":#000030
    );


/* Adding JS link to HTML file*/

    When you Download the Bootstrap Source Code files to add your project, you can add JS to your file as below:

    <script src="bootstrap/dist/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script>


/* Using FontAwesome Icons */
    Step 1: Go to "https://cdnjs.com/libraries/font-awesome" and add the Font Awesome CDN link to your HTML file.

    Step 2: Find your desired icon on font awesome and copy its code and add it anywhere in your code.


/* Adding Icon to the Title*/
    Step 1: Go to "https://icons8.com/icons/set/favicon" and find your desired icon.

    Step 2: Download the .png file and using an online convertor, convert your image to .ico format.

    Step 3: Add your icon to your HTML file as below:
        <link rel="icon" type="image/x-icon" href="images/favicon.ico">


/* Making working Forms */

    Go to "https://web3forms.com/" to generate an API key and to incorporate the required code into your form.


/* Navbar */
    -> 'navbar-dark' makes the navbar text white!

    -> To make the background image go all the way upto and under the navbar, add the following code to your navbar
    .navbar{
        position:absolute;
        top:0;
        right:0;
        left:0;
    }

        ->Drawbacks of doing this:
            1. You can make the Navbar stick to the top. 'sticky-top' does not work!


            2. Now this craetes aproblem for me. The text written on the showcase goes all the way up and is no longer vertically aligned in the center of the showcase. Therefore, I add padding to the showcase as below:
                padding-top:250px;
